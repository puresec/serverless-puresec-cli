## Quick Start

**1. Install via npm:**

```bash
npm install --save-dev serverless-puresec-cli
```

**2. Add serverless-puresec-cli to your serverless.yml:**

In your project's `serverless.yml` file add the following entry to the plugins section: `serverless-puresec-cli`. 
If there is no plugin section you will need to add it to the file.

It should look similar to this:
```yaml
plugins:
  - serverless-puresec-cli
```

**3. Validate:**

You can check wether you have successfully installed the plugin by running the serverless command line.

```bash
serverless
```

the console should display **puresec** as one of the plugins now available in your Serverless project.

**4. Start using the tool:**

Generate the IAM role for your function.

```bash
serverless puresec gen-roles --function myFunction
```

After receiving the IAM role in the output of the tool:

1. Validate the role. Make sure you have all the required permissions and only them.
2. Copy-paste it to the Resources section in your serverless.yml file.
3. Connect the generated Role by adding the **role** property to your function in the serverless.yml.

**5. You can also execute the tool on the entire project:**

```bash
serverless puresec gen-roles
```
