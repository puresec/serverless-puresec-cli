## Quick Start

**1. Install via npm:**

```bash
npm install --save-dev serverless-puresec-cli
```

**2. Add serverless-puresec-cli to your serverless.yml:**

In your project's `serverless.yml` file add the following entry to the plugins section: `serverless-puresec-cli`. 
If there is no plugin section you will need to add it to the file.

It should look similar to this:
```yaml
plugins:
  - serverless-puresec-cli
```

**3. Validate:**

You can check wether you have successfully installed the plugin by running the serverless command line.

```bash
serverless
```

the console should display **puresec** as one of the plugins now available in your Serverless project.

**4. Start using serverless-puresec-cli:**

Generate roles for your entire project.

```bash
serverless puresec gen-roles
```

The tool will ask you a few questions and then do its best to generate least privileged IAM roles.

**5. You can try the tool by executing it on a single function**:

```bash
serverless puresec gen-roles --function myFunction
```
